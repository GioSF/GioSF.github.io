 Certainly looking forward to, in a concentrated way, practicing the strategies and growing my skills as a practitioner, mother, daughter, friend, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 Seeing and practicing the implementation of all of these skills. I have experienced by watching my coworkers, but it will be fun to learn, watch and use these skills in a different setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I am looking forward to in person, hands on, training from the professionals at KPICD! I believe there is still so much to learn about TBRI and about myself on my own healing journey. I anticipate that the in-depth training will provide a greater understanding of all the different aspects of TBRI, and how to implement TBRI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Connecting with new people and hearing their experiences as well as learning how to tie this together and use it in a work setting that is feasible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 I'm hoping to learn how to put it all into practice and be able to use it. I'm looking for more understanding on how to use the IDEAL response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 I look forward to the in-person part of this training. Hearing it all come together with others examples of their struggles and successes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 I am most looking for to learning more of the science and neurobiology to connect that to how nurture and structure can change the brain rewiring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Practicing! I think practicing the skills is so important. I want to come home from the training feeling confident in my abilit to effectively facilitate a nurture group and communicate TBRI priniciples with my colleagues and caregivers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I'm most looking forward to feeling confident about doing TBRI. The more I do it the more it will be ingrained. More info on sensory. I would like to read the book, The Connected Therapist: Relating Through the Senses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 I am most looking forward to connecting the process in the 5 day training. A lot of the concepts of TBRI have already been explored or implemented within in my agency. However, these concepts have really been explored in an almost silo and not connected in a way that TRBI has connected the concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 Hearing others' ideas about the training and process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 I'm looing forward to diving deeper into the TBRI principles and practices and gaining practical skills for how to apply TBRI in my sphere of work. I'm hopeful for some guidance on how to apply these strategies on an organizational level, not just in direct practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 I love learning, so I am looking forward to sitting in front of great teachers and listening to them talk about TBRI and their experiences with TBRI practice. I am excited about learning ways to best support my clients through TBRI as well as practical tools and strategies to implement TBRI.

 I am looking forward to being able to cement this new information through an in person training as well as make connections with others who are taking the practitioner training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 I'm looking forward to networking with others in Phase II and comparing notes.  I have some questions and ideas that I want to run by others that are in the same process.  I'm also looking forward to being able to teach this material to others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 Meetings the colleges, hearing their experiences, learning from others application or new ways of applying these concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Interactive learning and reading are difficult for me, as is computer-based learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Feeling confident in understanding TBRI and being able to bring it back to our community in a capacity that allows me to begin to train and equip others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 I'm looking forward to in person learning, to help reinforce what i've learned on my own.  Seeing these skills put into practice.  I am excited to be with like-minded people that have the desire to love on those we serve in a way that goes so far beyond what we could have imagined for them... brining healing!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I am most looking forward to meeting TBRI practitioners and being able to ask questions, and to see real-life applications to the concepts we've learned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 I'm looking forward to seeing how to apply this in a training perspective. I feel like I have a good grasp of the concepts myself, but want to know how to effectively teach others and lead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 In Phase II, I am really looking forward to putting knowledge gained into practice and building muscle memory through further learning and role play among mentors and peers. It is easy for me to teach about trauma-informed care. Role playing and learning in the presence of mentors will help to take the knowledge from what I can teach, to how I live day to day from within my family all the way to the organizational level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 More in-depth training on interventions, in particular the correcting steps. Learning more about relational trauma and how it presents in children/adults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 I am looking forward to learning more! I can easily see how this helps me personally but I really want to see how this works for us as an organization. Because so much of this is new to us, I hope to be able to comprehend more and see how it all works together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 I am most looking forward to hearing from others in this course and learning from others' experiences applying in their work. I can't wait for my interview and for Salt Lake City!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 I am most looking forward to in Phase II so that I can put into practice this work within my organization and I can help cover these topics with future adoptive parents  to create safe environments for the children they adopt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Meeting other people who are going through the training and learning from TBRI Trainers and Practitioners specific ways to implement the practices in my organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 Pulling it all together into a cohesive picture.  I have most of the pieces, but haven't formulated it into a whole. Also how to spread TBRI practice to the partners and courts.  Also, I'm a verbal processor, so I am looking forward in being with other to process the information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 I have expectations of TBRI becoming so habitual that I do not have to think about it so much. I want it to become automatic.  I want to be able to articulate TBRI to other caregivers in a way that makes an impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I am looking forward to really expanding my knowledge of TBRI and being able to implement it on a wider basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 Gaining a deeper knowledge and understanding of TBRI.  Being able to implement it more effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 I'm looking forward to diving in more to each topic. I'm looking forward to hearing from the speakers and trainers and having in-person lecture. Meeting other practitioners and networking with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I am looking forward to the bringing it all together.  How do I begin to bring these principles into interventions with families and cultural practices in my organizations.  I look forward to working with like minded individuals to grow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Learning, growing, and becoming more equipped for the tasks of parenting, teaching, and leading. I'm super excited about this journey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I am looking forward to the opportunity to learn all of these in real time!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 Some of the things that I'm looking forward to in Phase II are really applying these things. Through role play and in person training and hearing from other's experiences, I know I'll become even more knowledgable and excited to take what I learn and apply it to my day to day job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 I am most looking forward to apply these skills with peers and learn more from people within in the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Hands on instruction, which is how I learn best. Real life interactions are vital for me.

I am most looking forward to being around others and getting hands-on experience!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 Continued exposure to the theories associated with TBRI, and an opportunity to have live interactions with instructors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 I am so excited to gain in person skills.  I am hoping that there will be direct trainings, and scripts that I can learn and then implement in practice.  I want to feel like I come home with new things to share with families in crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 Reviewing all we have learned so far, hands on activities and actually putting it into practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Taking on the healing journey to help the children we seek to serve as they move beyond their traumatic histories toward hope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 Meeting everyone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Strategically planning on implementing the program in my agency,  I have learned new approaches in terms of positive behavior changes.; but getting staff on board will be somewhat challenging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Continuing to learn more ways to  learn to better connect children, learning more about myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 Being in person, online can be challenging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 I am really looking forward to putting into practice some of the concepts I have learned in phase 1, learning how I can implement these skills with the children and families that I serve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 I am so excited for Phase II. I am excited to see people in person who are doing this and who have experience. I am also glad that we will be in a safe place with support, so we can practice what all we have been learning through out Phase I. I know this will be a challenge and will come with more opportunities to grow/ learn, which makes me nervous but also ready to gain more insights. I want to have someone help me with tips for how I am doing TBRI as well as insights for how to incorporate this into my life in different ways. I’m excited to be part of this new journey.                                                                                                               
 I am most looking forward to talking with others about the ways they implement TBRI in their current settings, learning more about trauma and brain development, and learning ways that I can help staff implement TBRI principles in all of our foster homes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 Hearing about practical work outside of what I have already learned- individual work, fidelity, other ways to use this model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I am looking forward to the more hands-on activities and learning which will take the harder to understand concepts and personalize them so that we can then teach them to families that we work with. I also look forward to the time to be immersed in the learning and eliminating all of the distractions of the other responsibilities that we have at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 I am looking forward to getting more materials and ideas on how to implement TBRI in a school district this size.   I am also looking forward to practicing and processing the IDEAL response and hopefully meeting other people that I can connect with and share implementation ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 In the Phase II of this learning journey, I look forward to learning more practical skills and gain competence in preparing myself to share and teach others in the TBRI implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with the responsibility that comes with being a TBRI practitioner in a role where I already feel overextended. I look forward to the enthusiasm I usually walk away with when learning new skills that I can implement to help the children and families I serve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Seeing how to pull it all together                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Seeing how the whole thing works together. Seeing how to use this with teenagers and how to run a nurture group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I am really excited to learn more about attachment styles and how nurture groups could be implemented in schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 I'm looking forward to gathering with others from the course and hearing how their experiences with the content were. I am excited to hear how everyone is planning on using and implementing their certification. For the actual training, I think it is going to be helpful to have visuals and practice for the concepts we have been reading about. Discussing these concepts and hearing how others understand them in their context will allow me to think through a different lens than my own. I think it will be encouraging to be around others who have a similar passion for this subject.                                                                                                           
 I'm looking forward to in person interaction and learning to implement TBRI in my organization the most. I want to learn as much as possible to take it back to my staff. I know that once we fully implement this as our model of care we will have a great response from the youth and make a better impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 Being in person and really getting in the weeds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I look forward to learning more effective skills to meet the needs of the client and caregiver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 In phase II, I most look forward in learning effective methods of putting TBRI into practice. I am looking forward to learning more about the principles of TBRI and how to implement them into the every day work provided by my agency. I look forward to hearing more examples on how and when TBRI is implemented, utilizing real-world examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Connecting with others. Learning from others, what their doing well and where they need to grow, what they have learned. Practicing interventions and strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 Learning how to do hands on activities that will teach and deliver the material is a huge excitement. Tools such as being able to dysregulate to regulate, crash and bump type approaches will be exciting to learn and practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 continuing to reinforce and ingrain TBRI principles into my practice and see how the stronger I develop these skills for myself the better able I will be to serve my students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 first off, getting to go to the training with one of my therapists and both of us learning this side by side, getting to bounce ideas off eachother at the end of each day on how to apply this when we get back.  I look forward to learning from others and how they plan to apply these skills in their fields and just to see it all play out over the week!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I am delighted to meet with my assigned mentor Brandie from Utah and to meet Brooks from Colorado in person at Phase 11 (Connection!) . I am so fortunate to have these two powerhouse ambassador practitioners as colleagues to help my TBRI journey.  Putting all of these incredible concepts into practice and meeting future practitioners is something I greatly look forward to.  I know it will be life changing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Learning more about TBRI and getting to share and connect with others that are on this same journey as myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 Seeing people with experience put the principles into practice and coaching me through doing the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I am looking forward to connecting  with professionals in the field in person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 I   am loooking forward to spending a whole week focused on learning from professionals and being around like minded people who are doing the same                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 I look forward to building on what was introduced in phase 1 and doing it in person.  I do much better with application and in person contact with others.  I also look forward to bring TBRI back to my agency to start implementing  TBRI, the research, techniques, and strategies to the staff and different departments to have cohesion in the care for these families throughout our organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 I am so excited to dive into more of the science behind TBRI, with more explanation. I also am anxious to practice the principles and learn more practical techniques for working with children and families, that I can then pass on to my students. I am looking forward to the relationships to be formed with other trainees as well.

 I am a visual learner and am all about practicum. I am excited to work with others who are motivated to understand how to implement TBRI and actually get a chance to discuss and try out these methods in practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 I am really looking forward at how to put these concepts in motion in my everyday life as well as my work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Just moving onto the in person training, I have heard how wonderful and inspiring it is and I am looking forward to that energy and having relational interactions with others learning this in real time as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 I'm really looking forward to expanding deeper into how to successful integrate TBRI into our programing and meet with other like minded individuals to hear what has helped them, especially when it comes to working with older youth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 I am looking forward to practicing hands on, and meeting people who have such great experience in implementing this practice. I am excited to learn from people who have so much knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 learning more and in person. I can absorb information in a group environment. I feel there is so much to learn and am excited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 I am looking forward to the practical application in Phase II and becoming a practitioner so that I can share this wealth of knowledge with others in my school and district. I see a future where everyone is trauma informed and equipped with the tools and education needed to be successful with our children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 I am looking forward to see all of this in action. How it is applied. Working with the Practitioners and mentors to see implementation of strategies. And most of all getting the opportunity to network with others who are wanting to make life better for children and gleaning from their experiences to help me to be the best Practitioner I can be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 The interactions with other people and the presenters. I look forward to our conversations, discussions, and learning experience as a whole. I also look forward to expanding my professional network to collaborate in the future to help our children and youth in Utah.

 I look forward to hearing from others.

 I am excited to learn more about the implementation lessons learned by the KPICD and TBRI Practitioners."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Really everything- I know that Phase 2 will be more interactive and it will be about feeling TBRI rather than getting more comfortable with the concepts (like we've been doing so far).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 I am extremely excited to be immersed in the principles and practices during phase II, and the opportunity to really soak it in and prepare myself to use what I learn with families that are struggling.  I'm looking forward to the problem-solving aspect of learning what to do when families have questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 Reinforcement of the material and getting closer to it being engrained for quicker recall, plus application of strategies to grow in confidence in applying and teaching them. Joining the globally diverse group of TBRI practitioners. Meeting the other training participants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 "I think one of the things that I'm looking forward the most is being surrounded by like minded individuals that are compassionate and are looking for similar things, and that see TBRI as a life-saving and world changing intervention! It is really inspiring to see the testimonies from the parents and the changes in the children once you start practicing the interventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 Another thing that I'm happily surprised and looking forward to learning more is the experience that there is on how to create partnerships with organizations to expand the wisdom. In a way it sometimes feels overwhelming to feel like I'm going agains the current, but knowing that it has already been implemented with organizations and there is knowledge on how to partner with organizations and create change really is inspiring."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I am looking forward to meeting others who are on this same journey as I am.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 Deeper understanding of the concepts.  Practical understanding and implimentation strategies.   Helping form scripts for older children (teens)  to use possibly in place of  scripts likelisten and obey first time"."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 I'm looking forward to the personal connections I'll make at the training. I'm eager for a deeper understanding through experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 I am looking forward to learning more about the implementation and expansion process and what it takes to become a KPICD partner. TBRI is not well known at all in New York, especially upstate. We are very eager to bring this to Monroe County’s child welfare system and (hopefully) beyond!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 The general learning and the implementation of skills. I feel that I generally understand the concepts, but I am a visual and hands on learner, so I look forward to practical application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 I am excited for the hands on work with trained instructors.  I also love learning from my peers.  I am excited that we are meeting in person rather than virtually.  Such a great opportunity!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 Learning how we as a team can make these practices a doable reality. I am hoping to see how our agency can work together to change the way we interact with our clients and give the kids the stability they need and deserve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 I am looking forward to being in person and dialogue with other individuals passionate about this subject. I look forward to having these concepts further engrained and understood so I can effectively implement them. I am excited to see more examples of these concepts so I can understand how they look when they are implemented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 SO much!! I am excited to learn more deeply about the TBRI strategies, being able to meet and make connections with like-minded peers from different areas but with the same goal. Although I know it is going to be hard work, I am looking forward to being emerged in this so we can all soak in as much knowledge as we can and start making little changes that could turn into big changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I am looking forward to learning more of how to bring TBRI to my company and the steps that I can take to help my organization be immersed in TBRI. I also look forward to practicing the TBRI strategies and principles with other people and learn from others how to be better at TBRI. I cant wait to learn more about TBRI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I'm excited to learn from TBRI trainers who have been doing this a long time, and see what it's like to put all of this fully into practice!  I'm also excited to learn more about how to effectively train others to use it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Looking more into attachment and how it affects clinicians through our work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 I'm looking forward to getting together with like minded professionals and taking the learning to the next level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 I am looking forward to being able to ask questions, to have discussion, to talk with others who are in different phases of their journey with TBRI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 I would like to learn ways to integrate TBRI into the organizations that I work with.  A huge dream would be to introduce these principles to the USBE, which is already on board with Positive Behavioral Interventions, but lacks a statewide training around this, and doesn't have the additional context that TBRI adds in terms of interpersonal neurobiology, physiology and connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I want to learn to be a good mother, I want to fix whatever I have not done well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 Roleplaying. It is one thing to understand the theory of TBRI, but I am looking forward to actually using the tools in real life scenarios.

 There are many gaps in understanding because I didn't connect with this method of information delivery. I'm looking forward to filling in the gaps by being in a physical setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 I can't wait to learn more about how to specifically apply TBRI within the school context. I want to hear from others who have been successful and see what a truly trauma-informed classroom" looks like. I'd like to come back to my community with tools and training to share. I am so thankful that I have been selected as an agent of change that can bring hope and healing to our community."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I am looking forward to learning this information as a much deeper level and actually applying it.  I can't wait to practice and self-reflect; I want to grow in my practice.

 Well this platform gave me the theoretical approach, but I'm looking forward to Phase II, as it will be the practical side of the program. The information is great, but the hands on approach validates is worth, and in itself creates several aha moments, as one will be able to see the truth behind the methodology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 A further in detail about TBRI, as such so I know what I am doing and how I am implementing it correctly being able to lead others as a future practitioner.
